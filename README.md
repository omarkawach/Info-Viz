## Purpose

Little free libraries have been growing in popularity over the years.
Despite the fact that communities gain from literacy, landmarks, art, culture, and sharing, little research has been done to comprehend LFLs and how / why / where they pop up. Little Free Library Demographics Explorer aims to use demographic information coupled with LFL location data to gather new insights.

## Features

- Leaflet map with one-way interactivity and info panel
  - Click a feature on the map to highlight it in the chart and show more details in the info panel
